# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

While coding this project, I thought that the recipes section was rather lackluster. I would add a carousel displaying videos of recipes handpicked by the "Practicum Coffee Shop". I also thought that a search function for recipes that are not displayed would be useful here.
